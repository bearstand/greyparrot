This is an Android mp3 recorder. It uses LAME MP3 encoder. It refered code from https://github.com/yhirano/Mp3VoiceRecorderSampleForAndroid.
It is a recorder that can be used. not only an trial of the MP3 encoder. 

The first version was published on amazon : http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TF4637Q/ 

The UI is not so nice, I am improving it. While it is stable and with basice functions: record, play, file management, share. The  recoded voice quality is good and the file it produce is mall.
